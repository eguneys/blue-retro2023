## Blue Retro JS2023 PostMortem

I made a game for JS13k called Blue Retro, which you can play [here]().

Here's what it looks like:

![blue retro js13k]().

Let me tell you it's story.

I was trying to learn about AI to make a bot that can play poker. Then they called me for my planned entry into psychiatric service.

Ok too personal, but since then my everyday work had been going nearly perfect. This game is the result of my well personal being and my super luck.

Anyway, game is about a 2d platformer character, trying to be pleased by the player. It gives you clues to how you should click buttons. Then it gets a little challenging.

I really wanted people to finish my game, so I put presents to make them happy. So there is a secret code at the end of the game, which encodes your progress. So how about people send me the codes, then I share a final leaderboard.

I will confess, I have lots of free time and nothing else to do, so I started right after I released from the hospital after 3 weeks, which was about right when they announced the JS13k is coming soon. 

ChatGPT has been my biggest supporter, I put some interesting links in this repo's README, so please check them out.

I also have a discord where I share pixel art and game dev topics that I find interesting, [here](https://discord.gg/6CnntAz9).

So art belongs to [this guy](https://twitter.com/_V3X3D/status/1683813077022658562?s=20), thanks to him.

Colors I used belongs to [this guy](https://twitter.com/mr_catfry/status/1684182716051234818?s=20), thanks to him.

Audio code, and music belongs to [https://github.com/arikwex/infernal-sigil](https://github.com/arikwex/infernal-sigil), thanks to him.

Let's get into details;

I am writing this post mortem, while coding the game, I don't know if people do that, but it's not something to be written after you develop the game.

I also have been active in Slack group, so check that out too.
